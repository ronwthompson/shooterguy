# Megaman for NES: a JavaScript recreation

Megaman is a classic era video game, originally made for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  While the game is fundamentally simple to play, it provides many challenges to program.  This is a work-in-progress respository of my recreation of the game in JavaScript.
